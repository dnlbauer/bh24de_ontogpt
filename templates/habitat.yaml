        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            a semicolon-separated list of taxonomic species extracted from the input.
            A species is a taxonomic rank below the genus and used in biology to classify organisms.
            Example species: Panthera leo;Lathyrus vestitus;Boa constrictor;Tyrannosaurus rex
        multivalued: true
        range: Species
      genus:
        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            a semicolon-separated list of taxonomic genera (genus).
            A genus is a taxonomic rank above species. It is the first part of the species name.
            Examples: For the species Panthera leo, the corresponding genus is Panthera.
            For Lathyrus spp., the genus is Lathyrus.
