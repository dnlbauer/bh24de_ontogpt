  HabitatAnnotations:
    description: A set of extracted annotations from a habitat describing the location and present organisms
    tree_root: true  # this is the main entrypoint of annotations
    attributes:
      species:
        description: >-
          semicolon-separated list of species.
          A species is a taxonomic rank used in biology to classify organisms.
          Examples: Panthera leo;Lathyrus vestitus;Boa constrictor;Tyrannosaurus rex,C. elegans
        multivalued: true
        range: Species
      genus:
        description: >-
            a semicolon-separated list of taxonomic genera (genus).
            A genus is a taxonomic rank above species.
            The genus can be given in various formats.
            For example, Lathyrus vestitus, L.vestitus, Lathyrus spp. all are of the genus Lathyrus
            Sometimes, the genus can be inferred from its common name.
            For example, the genus of a birch tree is Betula.
        annotations:
          prompt.example: Lathyrus;Panthera;Tyrannosaurus,Caenorhabditis
        multivalued: true
        range: Genus
      environments:
        description: >-
            an English term that best classifies the described region.
            If there is a matching term from the ENVO ontology, this should be used.
            If no description is given or the description is insufficent, this field should be undefined.
        annotations:
          prompt.example: cave entrance;river island; artificial reef;oak woodland
        multivalued: false
        range: Environment
      characteristics:
        range: Characteristic
        multivalued: true
        description: >-
          a semicolon-separated list of characteristics of the found environment translated to english.
          If there are no characteristics, this is undefined.
          Examples: For "an oak forest located at the north east slope of a hill", this is
          "north east slope of a hill". For "on a mossy stone", this is "stone;mossy"
